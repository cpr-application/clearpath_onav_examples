# A simple script to get the current GPS position and output the
# following in CSV style:
#    latitude,longitude,point_name
#
# Note that the point_name is taken from input 1 on the command line.
# The typical use would be to append the output to a file.
#
# Note that the position here is only based on GPS. For full
# localization, consider the /localization/odom topic instead.
